# 6. The derivative

# Write a program that implements the function  ùëì(ùë•)=ùë•(ùë•‚àí1) 
# (a) Calculate the derivative of the function at the point  ùë•=1
# using the derivative definition:

# dùëìdùë•=limùõø‚Üí0ùëì(ùë•+ùõø)‚àíùëì(ùë•)ùõø
 
# with  ùõø=10‚àí2 . Calculate the true value of the same derivative analytically and compare it with the answer your program gives. The two will not agree perfectly. Why?

# (b) Repeat the calculation for  ùõø=10‚àí4,10‚àí6,10‚àí8,10‚àí10,10‚àí12  and  10‚àí14 . How does the ac
# curacy scale with  ùõø ?

f = lambda x : x*(x-1)
derivative = lambda d : (f(1+d)-f(1))/d

print("the derivative of the function f at the point  ùë•=1 is : ", derivative(0.01))
# The Analitical derivative is 1
# The computed derivative is 1.010 -- > which is different from the analitical derivative
# Because the in forumla the delta approaches continually to the value of 0, Unlike the computed derivative which is given a dicrete value of
# delta and it's not close enough to zero
# So, The more delta get smaller ( closer to zero) the more the results are more accurate
